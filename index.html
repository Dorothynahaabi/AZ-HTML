        <h1>What is Technology</h1>
        <p>Technology is the application of knowledge for achieving practical goals in a reproducible way.
            The word technology may also mean the products resulting from such efforts such as utensils or 
        machines, and intangible ones such as software. Technology plays a critical role in science, 
    engineering, and everyday life. </p>

solutions to many everyday problems humans have faced all throughout history. </p>
     <!--Examples of types of Technolgy-->
     <h2>Types of Technology</h2>
<p><b>Mechanical Technology</b> is one of the simplest forms of technology, both in its application and its 
 design. <u>Mechanical technology</u> is the use of simple machines to solve problems. This includes the use of
 pulleys, levers, wheels and axles, wedges, inclined planes, and even cogs and gears. Any machine, 
 generator, pr tool used to do work uses mechanical technology.</p>
 <p><b>Medical Technology</b> is the application of scientific knowledge to solving problems in the human body 
  Doctors and other medical experts use it to discover symptoms to prevent, delay and treat diseases. Examples
of medical technolgy include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>MRI Scanners</li>
    <li>Remote Patient Monitoring</li>
